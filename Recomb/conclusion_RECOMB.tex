\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article we presented a new 
 pseudo energy model taking into account the energetic contribution 
of the stacked base pairs and the isostericity of all base pairs. 
We also showed that a secondary structure allows to efficiently
explore the mutational landscape and that we can benefit from the
 conserved consensus secondary structures  information
to identify and fix sequencing errors.


By combining those two approaches, the pseudo energy and the 
mutational landscape exploration, we are able  to efficiently 
correct randomly mutated 5s rRNA sequences. 
As presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:results},
we observe that the models
with larger weights on the
isostericity seems to hold a higher accuracy on the estimation of errors.
Importantly, the implementation is fast enough for practical applications.

We must point out that our approach can only detect point wise 
sequencing errors, and only if they are located in base pairs. It 
nonetheless supplements well existing tools by using previously discarded
information.
