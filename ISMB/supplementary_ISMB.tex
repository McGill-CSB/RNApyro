\section{Supplementary data}
\subsection{RNAinverse}
Using the same dataset of $50$ structures, we generated $100$ samples
per structure with \RNAinverse. They yield for most parameters
a high entropy. For all structures that have been solved 
by the three methods, only \RNAinverse, only \texttt{Incarnation} and
\texttt{Incarnation} followed by \RNAinverse,
we present for every different concentration of \texttt{C+G}
the average sample entropy and the average base pairs entropy.

%The same analysis but only for structures solved by \texttt{Incarnation}
%and \texttt{Incarnation} followed by \RNAinverse, is presented in
