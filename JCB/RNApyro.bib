	higher than previously thought. One important caveat with this method
	is that sequencing error could artificially inflate diversity estimates.
	Although the per-base error of 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing has
	been shown to be as good as or lower than Sanger sequencing, no direct
	assessments of pyrosequencing errors on diversity estimates have
	been reported. Using only Escherichia coli MG1655 as a reference
	template, we find that 16S rDNA diversity is grossly overestimated
	unless relatively stringent read quality filtering and low clustering
	thresholds are applied. In particular, the common practice of removing
	reads with unresolved bases and anomalous read lengths is insufficient
	to ensure accurate estimates of microbial diversity. Furthermore,
	common and reproducible homopolymer length errors can result in relatively
	abundant spurious phylotypes further confounding data interpretation.
	We suggest that stringent quality-based trimming of 16S pyrotags
	and clustering thresholds no greater than 97\% identity should be
	used to avoid overestimates of the rare biosphere.},

  abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible
	for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous
	and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping
	parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information
	about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular
	structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation,
	classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose
	a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge,
	hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three
	distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the
	Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred
	to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two
	orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative
	to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types
	with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric
	type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced.
	High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently
	available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl
	or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second
	base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups
	on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the
	standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition
	of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry,
	and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional
	motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions
	are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary
	structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology
	modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

  abstract = {The development of algorithms for designing artificial RNA sequences
	that fold into specific secondary structures has many potential biomedical
	and synthetic biology applications. To date, this problem remains
	computationally difficult, and current strategies to address it resort
	to heuristics and stochastic search techniques. The most popular
	methods consist of two steps: First a random seed sequence is generated;
	next, this seed is progressively modified (i.e. mutated) to adopt
	the desired folding properties. Although computationally inexpensive,
	this approach raises several questions such as (i) the influence
	of the seed; and (ii) the efficiency of single-path directed searches
	that may be affected by energy barriers in the mutational landscape.
	In this article, we present RNA-ensign, a novel paradigm for RNA
	design. Instead of taking a progressive adaptive walk driven by local
	search criteria, we use an efficient global sampling algorithm to
	examine large regions of the mutational landscape under structural
	and thermodynamical constraints until a solution is found. When considering
	the influence of the seeds and the target secondary structures, our
	results show that, compared to single-path directed searches, our
	approach is more robust, succeeds more often and generates more thermodynamically
	stable sequences. An ensemble approach to RNA design is thus well
	worth pursuing as a complement to existing approaches. RNA-ensign

  abstract = {{Motivations: The design of RNA sequences folding into predefined
	secondary structures is a milestone for many synthetic biology and
	gene therapy studies. Most of the current software uses similar local
	search strategies (i.e. a random seed is progressively adapted to
	acquire the desired folding properties) and more importantly do not
	allow the user to control explicitly the nucleotide distribution
	such as the GC-content in their sequences. However, the latter is
	an important criterion for large-scale applications as it could presumably
	be used to design sequences with better transcription rates and/or
	structural plasticity. Results: In this paper, we introduce IncaRNAtion,
	a novel algorithm to design RNA sequences folding into target secondary
	structures with a predefined nucleotide distribution. IncaRNAtion
	uses a global sampling approach and weighted sampling techniques.
	We show that our approach is fast (i.e. running time comparable or
	better than local search methods), seed-less (we remove the bias
	of the seed in local search heuristics), and successfully generates
	highquality sequences (i.e. thermodynamically stable) for any GC-content.
	To complete this study, we develop an hybrid method combining our
	global sampling approach with local search strategies. Remarkably,
	our glocal methodology overcomes both local and global approaches
	for sampling sequences with a specific GC content and target structure.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: S-attributed grammars (a generalization of classical Context-Free
	grammars) provide a versatile formalism for sequence analysis which
	allows to express long range constraints: the RNA folding problem
	is a typical example of application. Efficient algorithms have been
	developed to solve problems expressed with these tools, which generally
	compute the optimal attribute of the sequence w.r.t. the grammar.
	However, it is often more meaningful and/or interesting from the
	biological point of view to consider almost optimal attributes as
	well as approximate sequences; we thus need more flexible and powerful
	algorithms able to perform these generalized analyses. RESULTS: In
	this paper we present a basic algorithm which, given a grammar G
	and a sequence omega, computes the optimal attribute for all (approximate)
	strings omega(') in L(G) such that d(omega, omega(')) < or = M, and
	whose complexity is O(n(r + 1)) in time and O(n(2)) in space (r is
	the maximal length of the right-hand side of any production of G).
	We will also give some extensions and possible improvements of this
	algorithm.},

  abstract = {{The analysis of the relationship between sequences and structures
	(i.e., how mutations affect structures and reciprocally how structures
	influence mutations) is essential to decipher the principles driving
	molecular evolution, to infer the origins of genetic diseases, and
	to develop bioengineering applications such as the design of artificial
	molecules. Because their structures can be predicted from the sequence
	data only, RNA molecules provide a good framework to study this sequence-structure
	relationship. We recently introduced a suite of algorithms called
	RNAmutants which allows a complete exploration of RNA sequence-structure
	maps in polynomial time and space. Formally, RNAmutants takes an
	input sequence (or seed) to compute the Boltzmann-weighted ensembles
	of mutants with exactly k mutations, and sample mutations from these
	ensembles. However, this approach suffers from major limitations.
	Indeed, since the Boltzmann probabilities of the mutations depend
	of the free energy of the structures, RNAmutants has difficulties
	to sample mutant sequences with low G+C-contents. In this article,
	we introduce an unbiased adaptive sampling algorithm that enables
	RNAmutants to sample regions of the mutational landscape poorly covered
	by classical algorithms. We applied these methods to sample mutations
	with low G+C-contents. These adaptive sampling techniques can be
	easily adapted to explore other regions of the sequence and structural
	landscapes which are difficult to sample. Importantly, these algorithms
	come at a minimal computational cost. We demonstrate the insights
	offered by these techniques on studies of complete RNA sequence structures
	maps of sizes up to 40 nucleotides. Our results indicate that the
	G+C-content has a strong influence on the size and shape of the evolutionary
	accessible sequence and structural spaces. In particular, we show
	that low G+C-contents favor the apparition of internal loops and
	thus possibly the synthesis of tertiary structure motifs. On the
	other hand, high G+C-contents significantly reduce the size of the
	evolutionary accessible mutational landscapes.}},
